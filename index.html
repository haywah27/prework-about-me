      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>Hi there! My name is Hayley and I love the sunshine, which may be ironic because I grew up in the Northwest. I graduated from the University of Oregon with a Bachelor of Art and Technology degree and I currently work at Home Depot as a merchandise execution associate- we get to do things like keeping the shelves stocked as well as set the "seemingly earlier every year" seasonal displays. I love to learn new things, especially skills that allow for innovative and creative experiences in the process. I hope to one day grow up to be a wave chasing surfer beach bum!</p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>I was born in El Paso, Texas but think of Eugene, Oregon as my home.</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>I'm a retired Ultimate Frisbee athlete but still love to toss the ol' disc now and again. I also love being in the beautiful northwest outdoors with my doggo.</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>At the moment, any job or work that I can be proud of while having a light heart in the process.</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>Eugene, OR</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>What makes me the most excited about this career path is the thought of having the opportunity to be creative, collaborative and innovative on a daily basis.</p>
